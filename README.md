# Fraud Detection for E-commerce and Banking Transactions

## Overview
This project focuses on improving fraud detection for e-commerce transactions and bank credit transactions. The goal is to develop robust fraud detection models that address the unique challenges of these transaction types. Key techniques include geolocation analysis and transaction pattern recognition to enhance detection accuracy.

## Business Need
Adey Innovations Inc., a leader in financial technology, aims to enhance fraud detection to improve transaction security and reduce financial losses. By leveraging machine learning and data analysis, we can more accurately identify fraudulent activities, ensuring better security for customers and financial institutions.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze and preprocess transaction data to prepare it for model training.
- Engineer relevant features to detect fraud patterns.
- Develop and train machine learning models for fraud detection.
- Evaluate and improve model performance.
- Deploy real-time fraud detection models with continuous monitoring.

## Data and Features
The project uses two datasets:
- **Fraud_Data.csv** – Contains transaction records with fraud labels.
- **IpAddress_to_Country.csv** – Provides geolocation information based on IP addresses.

Key data preprocessing and feature engineering steps include:
- Handling missing values through imputation or removal.
- Cleaning data by removing duplicates and correcting data types.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover fraud patterns.
- Merging datasets for geolocation-based fraud detection.
- Creating new features like transaction frequency, velocity, and time-based attributes.
- Normalizing and encoding categorical features for model training.

## Learning Outcomes
This project enhances skills in:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Feature engineering for fraud detection.
- Machine learning model training and evaluation.
- Real-time fraud detection system deployment.
- Continuous monitoring and improvement of fraud detection models.
